# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> For learning the library (step 2 of the HW), I actually took Joel's advice by making a temporary .js file to test out features and making example files. Although the library looks big, by focusing on each function, it allowed me to understand it better. I also used the README.md file to learn more features about the library. One aspect of the module's code that made it easy to understand was the names of the variable, functions were very appropriate, so it helped me understand what everything meant. Though, one change to make it easier would be to provide better details on implementation, as I would have to run the code in order to understand what was going on. I remember in the reading the subjects had the same problem.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> When I wrote comments, my goal was to select parts of the program to represent a more complex whole. I see abstraction as moving upward, so instead of specific details, I aimed to summarize. I tried to identify where parts were common. If I had to explain to a new CS142 students how to write an effective comment, I would say to provide information that is not obvious from the code itself. Your comment should not be complex - which is the point of raising the abstraction.

##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 15

##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> No

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> JSDOC was very difficult to figure out.
